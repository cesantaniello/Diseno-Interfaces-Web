Define a transition on the .box for the "left" property. 
Add JavaScript code to the clicked function to toggle the position of the box between left=0 and left=300, i.e., make the box move left to right and right to left when clicked.
(Can you make it move in a square path? Left->Right->Bottom->Right->Top)
